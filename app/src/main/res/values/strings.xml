    <string name="review1">This place is great! Atmosphere is chill and cool but the staff is also really friendly. They know what they’re doing and what they’re talking about, and you can tell making the customers happy is their main priority. Food is pretty good, some Indian classics and some twists, and for their prices it’s 100% worth it.</string>

The service we received was so amazing and we will definitely be back again. They made us feel welcomed and gave us an amazing experience.</string>

The food is absolutely amazing – everything we tasted melted in other mouths. Absolutely the best meal we had while in Agra. Highly recommend!</string>
